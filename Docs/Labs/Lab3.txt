2) Benefits of doing A2screenshots:
+The main benefit of prototyping is that you can visualize your project which will help you to write a code
+You prepare the foundation of your prject by constructing not only visual side but also a logical side
+Determination of actors and user cases help to divide the fuctionality and work
+Screenshots are beneficial because is could be shown to customer before the work start and save time on corrections from his side
